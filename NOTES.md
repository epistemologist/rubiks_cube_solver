 - make generation of move tables in PieceState optional?
 - allow saving of move tables
 - allow Move class to hold move with just permutation to save on computation
 - fix Move class - 4 R's don't have proper orientation
 - eventually, general NxN solver

Note: 2x2 and 3x3 solvers will need to be different than big cube solver, the latter will need to be generalized
